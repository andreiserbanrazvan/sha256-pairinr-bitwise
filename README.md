# sha256-pairinr-bitwise
c# implementations for procedarul generation / cryptographic functions

sha256 - is clearly the superior choice for generating an universe with millions of stars the result will be trully random , but big numbers will blow up the cpu if the procedure gen is in real time 
pairinr - is good at first but once you beyond 20k*20k the random element will flat and the universe will be all the same.
bitwise operation - good at first for small worlds , becomes unplayable as soon as you go explore the map of the universe beyond the orginal cam settings.
